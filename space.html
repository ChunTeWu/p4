    	 <h1>Overview</h1>

		    <p>Pull is a <b>third-person action/puzzle-platformer game</b> made by <b>Unreal Engine 4</b> that narratively takes place in a fantasy dream settings, filled with abundantly clever puzzle-solving sequences, cartoonish-like visual aesthetics and compelling narrative storyline. Distinct elements from other puzzle-platformer (i.e. environment-based interactions) and action (i.e. ability-based gameplay) game genres inspired the development of the game, however providing a slightly different approach to provide a unique gameplay experience. It intends to mainly attract puzzle and/or platform gamers, as well as action gamers who enjoy dynamic gameplay mechanics. There is no specific gender and domain targeted, thus making the game easily accessible and have all gamer types open to enjoy the unique gameplay mechanics.</p>

		    <h1>My Role</h1>

		    <p>For this project I took up the role of the group’s <b>level designer and part of the visual artist</b>. I was responsible for deciding the in-game content as well as part of the 3D models in the game. I used Maya for building our 3D models, which it can directly import the model into Unreal and worked very well. For level building, I used the default building engine in Unreal, which I can easily adjust the models and associate them with the Unreal blueprint. </p>

		    <h1>Game Concept</h1>

		    <p>The overall structure and flow of the game is relatively simple. Players begin their navigation in the game from the Main Menu, with other options such as Resolution to change the screen resolution of the game, or to simply quit the game. Then players are introduced to the game with a narrative dialogue that can be heard. Subsequent actions include a general tutorial and hints of the game and introductions of the game mechanics that players will have to use to play. After, players provide their own choice to either explore the game environment to collect the orbs, or get into the Primary Gameplay Mode that the game essentially revolves around in. Players have been given the choice to explore, and eventually have to use the abilities for the puzzle-solving or platforming elements of the game. If players fall or get hit by the enemies in the game, a respawn system has been established. However 3 deaths conclude in a Game Over, and bring players back to the Main Menu. If players are able to successfully proceed to a gate, they must find a way to open it in order to progress to the next section of the game.</p>

		    <h1>Game Map Overview</h1>

		    <p>The overall level design of the game is set on one entire setting, with each of the sections separated by the gates placed within the game. The main character begins at the bottom of the level, exemplified by the “Star”. The platforms surround a large tree, and players advance through a critical path to reach the end. The narrative aspects of the game are placed in certain areas and importance to inform the character and players the backstory of the game. The purple section shows the introductions of abilities, as well as additional information that players will require—though most of the instructions needed have been provided through pop-up spatial UI on Level 1. Not only does Level 1 introduce the “Attach” and “Attract” ability, but the level also provides additional information that players will need to know in order to progress with the level, thus creating dynamic gameplay. Enemies are introduced on Level 2 to provide dynamic conflict for players. In addition to the “Attach” ability-based platforming, moving platforms have also been added to provide dynamic gameplay. There is a mini-boss section in which players will have to overcome without attack the boss. Finally, a final boss awaits players that narratively resolves the game.</p>

		    <h1>Obstacle Decision Tree</h1>

		    <p>The game possesses main and subsequent objectives that players have the option to do as they progress throughout the levels. Since the game is highly based on level progression, the initial question players would have is if an obstacle is presented in front of them to prevent level advancement. If so, then their approach would depend on the type of obstacle it is; otherwise they may consider exploring the area to search for an item, or generally enjoy exploring. Players’ actions will differ if it is an obstruction or an enemy; if there is an enemy they would have to analyze on distance and their surrounding environment, then take action based on what they do or do not have. Conversely if it is an obstruction, they have to determine whether they can easily get through it using an ability, or they would have to explore to fill their Gravity bar in order to use such ability. Finding the orbs would provide sub-objectives for the players for not only rewarding them, but also allow them to use the ability more comfortably. This obstacle and decision tree do apply in all three sections of the game, with the narrative being implemented in some of these nodes, that generally lead them to the final goal of the game.</p>
