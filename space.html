    	 <h1>Overview</h1>

		    <p>Space Traveller is a <b>2D platformer game made by Unity base on a space themed narrative</b> which brings the players into an interactive side scrolling space adventure. The main objective is to explore each stage of the game and bring the Spaceman back home to his family. Each stage will have different objectives, as well as finding hidden objectives and to find the hidden exits of each level. Player is able to choose their own exits which may change the outcome of the narrative. As players explore each level they will encounter aliens, asteroids, teleporters, moving platforms, and spring platforms. These will either help, or hinder, players throughout each level. The premise of the story will revolve around the pilot of a crash landed spaceship. The player will be presented with several introductory scenes which will brief them on the background of the narrative. These scenes will be displayed in retro style of pictures to tell the story. Players will be able to flip through the scenes at their own pace, allowing them the time to read and enjoy the images. New scenes will appear after every completed stage to narrate the next portion of the narrative as well as notifying the players of their next objective. Players will be able to control the narrative by completing different objectives within certain stages.</p>

		    <h1>Narrative Arc</h1>

		    <p>The narrative begins with the spaceship crashing onto a planet. Player is given time to get use to the controls as well as get through a fairly simple stage with simple objectives. As the players progress through the narrative, the stages will get progressively harder. The players encounter alien lifeforms which will try to kill them. and platforms which will move, or bounce them around. Level 3 will mark a change in the game as a whole. Not only being the first foldback in our narrative, this levels style will also change to keep the players interested. Although it is essentially the same game with the same gameplay, players will get the feeling that it is different. This level will also prepare the player for the climax in level 5. Level 5 will be the climax of the game. This level will be similar to level 3, except it will be a lot harder. This portion will be the climax of the narrative as it will be the player’s last chance to return the character home. The resolution will be consisted of the transitional scenes which will give the ending to the game. Either it being a game over, or the player safely returning home on their planet.</p>

		    <h1>Major Beats</h1>

		    <p>In the beginning levels there is an introduction of the gameplay and level mechanics that players would have to be familiar with. However the beats begins to rise, as enemies (many of which will have a narrative significance) will challenge players to either confront or avoid. If players are capable to compose themselves, the confrontations would not be too difficult. The large gaps in between do provide the exploration phases, perhaps providing some narrative background or room for players to find some collectible items. In the middle section of the level, players’ skills are challenged through enemies and difficult platforms. The boss area in the middle level also provides a greater intensity in conflict, however there is a following break before re-engaging players through challenges again. This is also a section where a boss level would be present, thus increasing the narrative beat as the boss would have a significant role in the character’s narrative background. Following such event between each level are narrative cutscenes to provide the storytelling created by the team. The beat finally is in high intensity once players have reached the final boss platform.
