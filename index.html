		    <p>Chun Te Wu is a Taiwanese student currently studying in School of Interactive Art and Technology (SIAT) at Simon Fraser University. As an interactive art student, I am passionate about art and design, in particular to 3D molding design and game design. I was very interesting in building model before I came to Canada. I am experienced in building simple building, animal and machine model. With this background, I developed a strong insight in using different shapes and combinations to create unique compositions in my game level design. I hope this experience can help me to bring an unique experience to his audiences. </p>
